# Project Brief

## Audience

My target market is young adults ages 16 - 30 who are interested in saving money, but don't know how. Typical users would be college students on a fixed budget.

## Problem

The newest generation of young adults are generaly known by their elders of being bad with money. One of the easiest things you do to save money is to create a budget, but most don't know where to start. There is soo much information on the internet that it can be overwhelming.

## Solution

The solution is 'Moolahlah', a financial planner application that walks users though setting up and managing a budget. Easy bank integration helps users stay on top of their finances.

## Unique Value Proposition

By focusing on ease of use and the younger generation, Moolahlah can offer a tailored experience that is easy to use.
